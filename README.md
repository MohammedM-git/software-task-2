**Project: User Status Toggle App**  

This is a simple web application I built to manage user records with a toggle feature for their status. It’s currently running on my local development server (`localhost`).  

### **Features**  
- **Add Users**: A form with fields for **Name** and **Age**, plus a **Submit** button to add new entries.  
- **User Table**: Displays existing users with columns for:  
  - **ID** (unique identifier)  
  - **Name**  
  - **Age**  
  - **Status** (shown as `0` or `1` for inactive/active)  
  - **Action**: A **Toggle** button to switch the user’s status.  

### **How It Works**  
1. **Submit New Users**: Enter a name and age, then click **Submit** to add them to the table.  
2. **Toggle Status**: Click the **Toggle** button next to a user to change their status (e.g., from `0` to `1`).
